== Attention Eclipse (m2e or m2eclipse) Users ==

The build configuration that Maven Integration for Eclipse creates from this
POM yields an Eclipse project that won't compile. Here's how you fix it:

In the Package Explorer view:

 - Expand src/main/java
 - Right click on the parent folder of this README
 - From the popup menu, choose Build Path -> Use as Source Folder

The project should now compile, and dependent projects in your workspace
should now also build cleanly.

Note that you will have to repeat these steps every time you perform M2E's
Update Project Configuration feature.


The placement of this file in this directory is not an accident: without it,
the item that needs to be right-clicked upon does not exist in the Eclipse
Package Explorer view (empty packages are collapsed by default).
